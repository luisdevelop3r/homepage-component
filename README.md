# homepage-component

###Description

This project is the solution to a coding challenge from the devchallenge.io site that consisted in making a responsive homepage component with just <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets ">CSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Javascript">Javascript</abbr>.

i found it a challenge because i couldn't use any framework or library to help me make the layout, so i had to resort to ancestral techniques of positioning and state management.

there's not much more to say as it was a relatively simple challenge. give me a star if you like chocolateðŸ˜Ž
